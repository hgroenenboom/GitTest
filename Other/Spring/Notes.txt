Short notes for fullstack dev using Spring:

Example repository by FelixvL: https://github.com/FelixvL/GSWPresentatie

For hosting and database creation we use:
-> XAMPP
-> turn on apache and SQL.
-> create database at localhost/phpmyadmin.

We'll create the backend server with the Spring framework:
    -> start.spring.io
    -> generate project
    
    Import dependencies such as Felix's existing pom.xml
    - MySQL Driver
    - Spring Data JPA
    - Spring Web
    - JDBC API
    
1. First step connect database with framework

> Using instructions from the by Spring generated HELP.MD.

> Now able to access backend via http://localhost:8082/greeting
